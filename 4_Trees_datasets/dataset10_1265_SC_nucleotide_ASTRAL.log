================== ASTRAL-Pro ===================== 

This is ASTRAL-Pro (A-Pro) version 1.1.6
Using native AVX batch computing.
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
There are 8 threads used to run.
ti: 3
tx: 3
pw: 4
The number of input tree read is 1265
20240 trees read from sorted_trees_1265genes.tre
1265 extra trees.
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at KVEN1
