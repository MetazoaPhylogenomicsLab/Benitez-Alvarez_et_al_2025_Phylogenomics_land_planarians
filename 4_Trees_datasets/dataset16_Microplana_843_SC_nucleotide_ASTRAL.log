================== ASTRAL-Pro ===================== 

This is ASTRAL-Pro (A-Pro) version 1.1.6
Using native AVX batch computing.
Gene trees are treated as unrooted
There are 8 threads used to run.
ti: 3
tx: 3
pw: 4
The number of input tree read is 843
13488 trees read from all_gene_trees_843nuc_Microplana.tree
843 extra trees.
All output trees will be *arbitrarily* rooted at MIGR1
